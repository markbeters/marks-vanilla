## Classes

### Melee
##### Trimarang

Trimarang takes a lot of effort for something that is outclassed by Thorn Chakram. Thorn Chakram is not too powerful though, so this item just needs a small boost.

- Trimarang damage 21 --> 24


##### Blue Moon

Blue Moon is obtained at the same time as sunfury and is completely outclassed. Sunfury isn't OP though so this just needs to have a distinct effect. Much like the Muramasa vs Volcano, this will be faster with less knockback and aim for crits.

- Damage 54 --> 59
- Critical Chance 4% --> 11%
- Velocity 12 --> 15
- Knockback 6 --> 4


##### Flamarang

Flamarang is generally pretty weak because it only hits one target, it should "pierce" to make it worth using.

- Flamarang costs 15 hellstone bars to craft
- Flamarang travels further in launched direction on first impact

### Ranger

##### Gem Bullets

There is no option for guns to pierce until after evil bosses, but the time it is needed most is for the evil boss. These should serve as interim piercing bullets until meteor shot is obtained. Technically, meteor shot is obtainable pre-boss from golden chests near the underworld but why keep a piercing bullet so random?

All of them are craftable at an anvil, 1 gem gets 50 bullets. In general, rarer gems have better stats.

- Amethyst Bullet added
	- Damage = 0
	- Pierce = 2
	- Velocity = 11
- Topaz Bullet added
	- Damage = 0
	- Pierce = 2
	- Velocity = 11
- Emerald Bullet added
	- Damage = 1
	- Pierce = 2
	- Velocity = 12
- Sapphire Bullet added
	- Damage = 1
	- Pierce = 2
	- Velocity = 12
- Ruby Bullet added
	- Damage = 2
	- Pierce = 2
	- Velocity = 13
- Diamond Bullet added
	- Damage = 2
	- Pierce = 2
	- Velocity = 13


### Magic

##### Jungle Armour

Jungle armour is too strong compared to meteor, especially for a pre-boss armour. Removing damage and crit boosts keep the absurd mana pool and reductions without nerfing too heavily.

- Jungle Hat defence 5 --> 4
- Jungle Shirt defence 6 --> 5
- Jungle Shirt magic damage boost 6% --> 0%
- Jungle Shirt magic critical chance 0% --> 3%
- Jungle Pants defence 6 --> 4
- Jungle pants magic critical chance 6% --> 3%

##### Ancient Cobalt Armour

Let it keep the defence but nerf the damage, again for comparison to meteor armour. It makes this set worth grinding or shimmering the Jungle Armour for.

- Ancient Cobalt Breastplate magic damage boost 6% --> 0%
- Ancient Cobalt Breastplate magic critical chance 0% --> 3%
- Ancient Cobalt Leggings magic critical chance 6% --> 3%

##### Meteor Armour

Meteor Armour is not particularly useful for anything other than the space gun and gray zapinator. Sure, the 27% damage boost is a lot but many weapons' base damage at this stage is low, making the crit chance from Jungle Armor far superior. Not to mention, it has 1 less defence, no mana reduction and no mana increase. The new set bonus encourages players to use other low mana cost weapons to pair with this armour set.

- Meteor Armour set bonus no longer makes Space Gun, Gray Zapinator and Orange Zapinator cost 0 mana
	- On Magic Weapon attack, player is refunded 4 mana
