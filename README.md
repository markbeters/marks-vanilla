This project is intended to give some Quality of Life features to the core Terraria experience without being too "easy".
It also aims to provide minor balance changes to encourage the use of less common gear or setups.

A full list of changes can be found in the changelog.txt file in the main folder.


Massive shout-out to ExampleMod, Calamity Mod and AlchemistNPC. I referred to their works (published on GitHub) often to see how a bunch of class references would be used. 
I am not an experienced dev and am new to modding so using their code as references was incredibly useful in making this happen.
